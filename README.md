HOUSEMINT-AI
Intelligent House Price Prediction System

HOUSEMINT-AI is a Django based web application developed for house price prediction using machine learning. The system predicts house prices based on important features such as location, total area, number of bedrooms, and other housing parameters to help users make informed decisions.

Project Overview

This project integrates machine learning, data analysis, and web development into a single platform. A trained machine learning model is embedded into a Django web application to provide real time house price predictions through a simple and user friendly interface.
