# 🏠 HOUSEMINT-AI  
## Intelligent House Price Prediction System  
**Django • Machine Learning • Full-Stack Web App**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
HOUSEMINT-AI is a Django-based web application for predicting house prices using machine learning.  
The system predicts house prices based on key features such as **location, total area, number of bedrooms**, and other housing parameters to help users make informed real estate decisions.

This project integrates **machine learning, data analysis, and web development** into a single platform.  
A trained ML model is embedded into a Django web app to provide **real-time house price predictions** through a simple and user-friendly interface.
